## Financial Data Processing and Analytics Architecture

This architecture illustrates how financial data is processed and analyzed using Azure services. Below is a detailed explanation of each component and their interactions.

### Components Description

1. **Browser / Mobile App**
   - This is the front-end interface where users interact with the system.
   - Users can access and interact with the financial data through web browsers or mobile applications.

2. **Azure App Service**
   - This is the core of the web application where the business logic is executed.
   - Receives requests from the browser/mobile app and processes these requests.
   - Interacts with the financial data source to fetch or manipulate the necessary data.

3. **Financial Data from Multiple Sources**
   - Represents the various external financial data sources that provide raw financial information.
   - This data is collected and then sent to the Azure App Service for processing.

4. **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
   - This is the primary data storage component.
   - It stores processed financial data retrieved and manipulated by the Azure App Service.
   - Serves as the financial data source for further analytics and reporting.

5. **Power BI**
   - A business analytics tool.
   - Connects to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL to retrieve financial data.
   - Provides advanced analytics and visualization capabilities, enabling the end users to gain insights from the financial data.

### Workflow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system using browsers or mobile apps to request financial data or to perform operations on the financial data.
2. **Request Handling**: The requests are handled by the Azure App Service which processes the business logic related to the financial data.
3. **Data Fetching**: Financial data from multiple external sources are collected and processed by the Azure App Service.
4. **Data Storage**: The processed financial data is stored in Azure Database for PostgreSQL, serving as the main data repository.
5. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Power BI connects to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL to access the stored financial data. It then provides powerful analytics and visualizations to the end users for data-driven decisions.

This architecture ensures scalable, secure and efficient processing and analysis of financial data, leveraging the power of Azure cloud services.
