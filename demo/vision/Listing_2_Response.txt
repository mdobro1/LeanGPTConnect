In the heart of a city where history dwells,
A grand edifice of tales and time reveals,
Stands the palace with its gothic grace,
Guarding stories of a bygone space.

Beside the palace, tall and true,
A clock tower reaches towards the blue,
With faces four, it marks the hours,
Through sunlit days and rainy showers.

The bridge below, arching wide,
Carries throngs from side to side,
And in its stone and iron we see,
The spirit of this ancient city.

Clouds above in a dance so free,
Softly frame this scene of majesty,
While flags flutter in the gentle breeze,
Telling tales of lands across the seas.

The silhouette of history, proud and stern,
From this old vista, there's much to learn,
Each brick and stone, each iron cast,
A frozen moment from the past.
